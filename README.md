# SUTD-Autonomous-Driving
This is a project to code an autonomous driving RC car to navigate a race track without using SLAM. I am writing my code using pure reactive methods, and will be storing them here.

Everything under scripts is ros1

Everything else is ros2

Self driving codes are in sutd_ws/sutd_ws
